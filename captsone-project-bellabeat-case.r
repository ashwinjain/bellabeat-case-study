They offer a variety of technologies, including jewelry-like wellness trackers, a smart-watch, and smart water bottles. These products track user data relating to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits, which is readily available on their free mobile app. \n\nCurrently, Bellabeat primarily focuses on digital marketing, including Facebook and X(Twitter), and runs ads on Youtube and the Google Display Network. While this has proven successful in the past, Bellabeat would like to explore the data from user of other smart device companies to determine whether they should modify their marketing strategy. Perhaps smart watches are not popular amoungst the older generation, in which case, Bellabeat should shift its focus towards more traditional forms of marketing where the target audience is that older generation. Or perhaps we need to remind users to wear their device more often to allow them to gain more from their investment. \n\nThis study focuses on analyzing those trends, and applying what we learn to inform future Bellabeat marketing strategy for its smart watch.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Ask**\n#### **Business Task**\n\nAnalyze trends in non-Bellabeat smart watch usage to inform marketing strategy for Bellabeat’s smart watch\n\n#### **Key Stakeholders**\n\nUrška Sršen - Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n\nSando Mur - Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Prepare**\n\n#### **Origin and Description**\nThis case study relies on FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset was made available by Mobius and stored on Kaggle. 18 different datsets are stored in csv format, most of it being stored in long format. Each csv file tracks its own individual statistic, such as daily calories burned, daily steps, weight, etc.. These datasets were generated by an Amazon Mechanical Turk survey between March and May 12, 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the tracking and submitting personal data, including heart rate, physical activity, and sleep monitoring.\n\n#### **Privacy**\nThe data used in this study is all open sourced. It is freely downloadable, modifiable, reproducible, and distributable\n\n#### **Credibility**\nThe majority of the data recorded comes from the device itself, therefore with respect to that data, there is little bias or credibility. It is first party data collected directly from FitBit users with their consent. The data is from 7 years ago and not current. However, for the educational purposes of this case study, this is okay.\n\n#### **Summary of Datasets**\n\ndailyActivity_merged- tracks total steps and distance, and seperates that into very, moderately, light and active distances as well as the minutes for each of those categories as well, including sedentary minutes. It also tracks calories burned in total. Each day for the whole month\n\ndailyCalories_merged - tracks calories burned for each day for the whole month\n\ndailyIntensities_merged - tracks minutes and distances across four subcategories: very, moderately, lightly, and sedentary activity levels each day for the whole month\n\ndailySteps_merged - tracks daily steps for the whole month\n\nheartrate_seconds_merged - tracks heartrate multiple times every minute of every day for the whole month\n\nhourlyCalories_merged - tracks calories burned every hour of every day for the whole month\n\nhourlyIntensities_merged - tracks total intensity for every hour and average intensity per minute every day for the whole month\n\nhourlySteps_merged - tracks total steps for every hour of every day for the whole month\n\nminuteCaloriesNarrow_merged - tracks caloires burned every minute of every hour of every day for the whole month\n\nminuteCaloriesWide_merged - minuteCaloriesNarrow but in wider format for every hour\n\nminuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged - measurs intensity for every minute across the whole month\n\nminuteIntensitiesWide_merged - minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged but in wider format for every hour\n\nminuteMETsNarrow_merged - tracks the ratio of the energy used vs at rest every minute \n\nminuteSleep_merged - logs sleep by minute\n\nminuteStepsNarrow_merged - steps for every minute\n\nminuteStepsWide_merged - steps for every minute, wide format\n\nsleepDay_merged - measure the number of sleeps, total minutes slept, and total time in bed for each day\n\nweightLogInfo_merged- tracks weight at various times in pounds and kg, as well as their BMI, and whether they manually reported their weight \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Process**\n\nDue to the large data sets and need for quick analysis, I decided to use R for this project.\n\nMy analysis required the following R packages\n\n**Rcpp, magrittr, ggplot2, janitor, dpylr, readxl**\n\nLet's install them now","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# installing packages [Rcpp, magrittr, ggplot2, janitor]\nlibrary(Rcpp) # c++ integration\nlibrary(magrittr) # forward pipe operator (%>%)\nlibrary(ggplot2) # data plotting\nlibrary(janitor) # cleaning data\nlibrary(readxl) # reading excel files","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T22:50:38.501448Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T22:50:38.502743Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T22:50:38.52127Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"install.packages(\"dplyr\")\nlibrary(dplyr) # data manipulation","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T22:50:38.52449Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T22:50:38.525995Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T22:51:38.614912Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we have all the necessary dependencies, let's start reading in the excel files of the datasets we will use and store them as dataframes","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity = read_excel(\"/kaggle/input/bellabeat/dailyActivity_merged.xlsx\") # daily_activity df\ndaily_sleep = read_excel(\"/kaggle/input/bellabeat/sleepDay_merged.xlsx\") # daily_sleep df\nheartrate_seconds = read_excel(\"/kaggle/input/bellabeat/heartrate_seconds_merged.xlsx\") # heartrate_seconds df\nhourly_steps = read_excel(\"/kaggle/input/bellabeat/hourlySteps_merged.xlsx\") # hourly_steps df\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T22:51:38.617176Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T22:51:38.619355Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T22:51:40.916929Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(daily_activity, 5)\nhead(daily_sleep, 5)\nhead(heartrate_seconds, 5)\nhead(hourly_steps, 5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T22:51:40.919493Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T22:51:40.920735Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T22:51:41.001724Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see below the number of observations in each dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# prints the number of distinct 'Id' in each df   \nn_distinct(daily_activity$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_sleep$Id)\nn_distinct(heartrate_seconds$Id)\nn_distinct(hourly_steps$Id)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T22:51:41.003903Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T22:51:41.005044Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T22:51:41.054814Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Typically, we want at least an n of 30, but for educational purposes, we will continue with the study despite the two datasets that have low n-values","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We need to clean the data.
